# Measure-theoretic Crooks–Jarzynski infrastructure

This module contains the state-space-independent core of the development. A
Crooks relation is expressed as an equality of measures on an arbitrary
measurable trajectory space. Evaluating that equality on the whole space gives
the Jarzynski equality as a Lebesgue integral. Pushing the equality through a
measurable observable gives the corresponding fluctuation relation for its
probability law.

For one Markov step, the module derives the Crooks relation from two
measure-theoretic hypotheses: equilibrium reweighting under the quench and local
detailed balance as an equality of composition-product measures. Both results
hold on arbitrary measurable state spaces.

The module also adapts an ordinary time-inhomogeneous family of Mathlib Markov
kernels `K t : Kernel Ω Ω` to the history-dependent kernels expected by
Mathlib's Ionescu–Tulcea construction. Thus `trajectoryMeasure μ₀ K` is the law
of the full trajectory on `ℕ → Ω` for an arbitrary measurable state space.
