# Full continuous-time jump path laws

This module assembles the fixed-jump-count path laws from
`ContinuousTimeJump` into one measure on the dependent sum of all jump-count
sectors.  A sectorwise Crooks relation with a common free-energy factor then
sums to a Crooks relation for the full continuous-time path law.
