# The fixed-initial full path law of a general finite jump generator

The sector masses of a `FiniteJumpGenerator` sum to one, so the fixed-initial
sector laws assemble into an honest probability measure on the disjoint union of
all jump-count sectors.  This module builds that measure and identifies the
pushforward of its actual terminal coordinate.

The point of doing this at the measure level is fidelity: the transition mass
was defined as a sector sum, which is convenient for the arithmetic but is not
by itself a statement about the constructed path law.  Everything downstream is
phrased against `pathLawFrom`, so the sector sum only ever appears as an
intermediate evaluation.

/-! ### Evaluating the sector law -/

/-- Integrating a function of the terminal state against the fixed-initial
sector law reduces to the finite sum over state sequences.  Taking `q = 1`
recovers the sector mass and taking `q` an indicator recovers the terminal
sector mass, so this is the single bridge between the measure-level law and the
arithmetic developed on state sequences. -/
