# Fixed-horizon continuous-time jump paths

A fixed-jump-count path belongs to the horizon-`T` sector when its holding
intervals sum to `T`.  This condition is measurable and invariant under path
reversal.  Consequently a Crooks relation can be restricted to the horizon
sector, and the restricted sector relations can then be summed over all jump
counts by `FullPath.crooks_of_sector_relations`.
