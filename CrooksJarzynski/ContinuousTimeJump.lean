# Continuous-time jump-process Crooks infrastructure

This module isolates the measure-theoretic step needed to extend the existing
finite-horizon Crooks development to continuous-time processes.

A continuous-time path law is represented by a density with respect to a common
reference measure on path space. If the forward density, the reverse density
pulled back by time reversal, and the work factor satisfy the pointwise
Radon--Nikodym identity, then the abstract `MeasureProtocol.CrooksRelation`
follows. This is the part of a jump-process proof that is independent of the
specific construction of the continuous-time Markov law.

For Markov jump processes, a fixed-jump-count path is represented by its states
and holding times. The module defines measurable path reversal, a generic
factorized jump-path density, and Crooks/Jarzynski wrappers on that path space.
The remaining process-specific obligation is to prove the density identity from
escape-rate and local-detailed-balance hypotheses, and then to sum over the
number of jumps.
